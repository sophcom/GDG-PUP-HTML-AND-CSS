    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi there! I am Sophia, a 19 year old sophomore taking the course Information Technology at PUP Main, Sta. Mesa.
    <br>I'm still a newbie in programming so I hope to learn along side y'all! I'm also a slow learner and an introvert so please bear with me.</p>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I like <del>you</del>, I mean I like listening to music, mindlessly scrolling through social media, and watching pointless videos on youtube.
    <br>Aside from the said hobbies, I also <del>like</del>, no, <b>LOVE cats</b> (just cats in general) and <b>food</b> (cooking and baking).</p>
    <h2><del>Socials</del></h2>
    <p>Despite being on social media apps often, I don't share or upload content often so let's just cross that one out hehe</p>
